**[Discussion] What's your biggest ADHD productivity struggle right now?**

I've been experimenting with different approaches and I'm curious what's actually hard for people.

For me, it's starting tasks. I can plan forever but the actual starting... yeah.

What's yours? Maybe we can share what's helped.
```

**Post 2: Soft Share (After engagement)**
```
**[Update] Tried the 20-minute sprint thing - actually worked**

Posted last week about struggling to start tasks. Tried breaking everything into 20-minute chunks and... I actually finished 3 things yesterday.

Not saying it's magic, but for anyone else struggling with starting, this might help.

Happy to share what I did if anyone's curious (no selling, just what worked for me).
